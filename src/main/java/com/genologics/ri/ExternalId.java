 * An external id is a reference to an identifier in an external system that

 * External id is supported on representations that contain links back to

 * External id consists of two different URI type elements: id and URI. ID is
 * the URI referencing the external system, and provides context and
 * identification of the representation within that system. URI is the URI
 * within the system, and provides a means of looking up the representation that
 * the external id is associated with.
