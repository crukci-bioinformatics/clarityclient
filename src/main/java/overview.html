This project is the Cambridge Research UK Cambridge Institute (CRUK-CI)
Java client for Genologics' REST API.
</p>

<p>
It wraps a REST client to allow Java objects to be used for working with
the Clarity system. The object to XML translations are handled automatically,
as are the HTTP exchanges. It requires the Spring framework and uses many of
its features.
</p>

<p>
The model classes were originally generated from Genologics' XSD schema
documents. They are embellished with interfaces to distinguish between the
actual entities and the links to those entities. The classes as presented here
should allow users of this client to work with the Clarity API with minimal
overhead.
</p>

<p>
The XSD files are packaged with this project: all rights to these belong
to Genologics.
</p>

<p>
To use the client, create a Spring application context including the file
<code>org/cruk/genologics/api/genologics-client-context.xml</code>, from which
you can obtain the bean "<code>genologicsAPI</code>". If you wish to use the
caching facility, also add the file
<code>org/cruk/genologics/api/genologics-cache-context.xml</code> to the
application context path.
