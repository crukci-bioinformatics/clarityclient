/**
 * Interface to the Genologics Clarity API version 2 via REST.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface provides the basic methods one would expect to interact
 * with the server via REST. It and the objects under the {@code com.genologics.ri}
 * packages hide much of the trickiness from users of this class.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * All methods that make calls to the server throw some run time exceptions that
 * client code should expect and handle as appropriate:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * {@link GenologicsException} - thrown when the server sends back a response that
 * indicates an exception being raised on the server. The reply is automatically
 * unmarshalled and thrown as this equivalent Java exception.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * {@link GenologicsUpdateException} - indicates more an error in client code, where
 * an update is attempted on an entity that does not allow such an update. This can
 * apply to create, update and delete methods. Refer to the Genologics REST documentation
 * for details of what is and is not allowed.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * {@link IllegalStateException} - thrown when calls are made to the server before
 * the server URL has been set.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * {@link HttpClientErrorException} - thrown when a call to the server doesn't get as
 * far as being processed. A typical example is when the credentials have not been set.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * {@link IllegalArgumentException} - thrown when parameters that must clearly be given
 * are {@code null}. <i>entityClass</i> parameters are a prime example.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that since release 2.23.1 this library has changed to use the Apache HTTP
 * Components client rather than the old Commons HTTP Client v3.
 * </p>
